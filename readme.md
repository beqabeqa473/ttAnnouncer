# ttAnnouncer

NVDA addon for reading spoken events in TeamTalk application using tts different from main engine.

## Why does this addon exist
I am using TeamTalk application on daily bases for different purposes and sometimes besides voice communications there are frequent chat messages which can be interrupted by NVDA while working.
I want to stay focused what i am doing on and do not distract to read chats or flush them accidentally. So i wrote an addon which makes it possible to select a different text to speech engine from settings to read TeamTalk channel messages.
I know there is a possibility to use Sapi5 instead of a screenreader, but it doesn't work for me, as it is not possible to stop speech and select needed tts engine which is available only in NVDA in my case.

## Shortcuts
There is only one shortcut - NVDA+Shift+pause, which on first press stops incoming speech from TeamTalk and pressing twice toggles functionality to on/off.
